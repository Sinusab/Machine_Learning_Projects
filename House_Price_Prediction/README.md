# House Price Prediction

This directory contains two machine learning projects for predicting house prices using different algorithms: RandomForest and XGBoost. Both projects utilize the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle.

## Subdirectories
1. **[RandomForest](RandomForest/)**  
   - Uses RandomForestRegressor to predict house prices.
   - Includes preprocessing, PCA, and evaluation with RMSLE and R^2.

2. **[XGBoost](XGBoost/)**  
   - Uses XGBoost to predict house prices.
   - Includes preprocessing, PCA, and evaluation with RMSLE and R^2.

## Dataset
- Required files: `train.csv`, `test.csv`
- Place them in `House-Prices-Advanced-Regression/` relative to this directory or adjust paths in the scripts.
- Download from: [Kaggle House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
