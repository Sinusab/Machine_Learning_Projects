## Features
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and PCA.
- Model: RandomForestRegressor with 200 trees.
- Evaluation metrics: RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) and R^2 score.
- Visualization: Scatter plots and error histograms.

## Requirements
